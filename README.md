## Overview

This repository contains **all official documentation** for the NewNorth project.

NewNorth is a wrist-mounted navigation device designed to point directly toward meaningful locations rather than simply indicating magnetic north. The product is being developed in the open, and this repository serves as the **single source of truth** for its written artifacts.

This repository does **not** contain source code or hardware design files. Instead, it aggregates the documents that define *what the product is*, *why it exists*, and *how it is intended to be built and validated*.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

* Centralize all product, design, and technical documentation
* Provide transparency into the full product development process
* Serve as a reference for contributors, collaborators, and reviewers
* Demonstrate an end-to-end product development workflow

This repository reflects the evolution of the product over time, including decisions, trade-offs, and open questions.

---

## Repository Contents

This repository may include (but is not limited to):

* Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
* Technical Specifications
* Design Decision Records (DDRs)
* UX and interaction specifications
* QA and test plans
* Project notes and planning documents

Each document is intended to stand on its own while also fitting into a broader product narrative.

---

## How to Use This Repository

* Start with the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** to understand the product intent and scope
* Review technical and design documents to understand implementation approaches
* Use open issues or discussions (if enabled) to ask questions or propose changes

This repository is especially useful for:

* Engineers evaluating feasibility
* Designers reviewing interaction intent
* Contributors looking to understand the system before participating
* Anyone interested in how a hardware product is built end-to-end

---

## Project Status

NewNorth is an active, evolving project. Documents may change as assumptions are validated, constraints are discovered, and the product matures.

Nothing in this repository should be considered final unless explicitly marked as such.

---

## Contributions

Contributions, feedback, and discussion are welcome.

If you are interested in contributing:

* Review existing documents for context
* Propose changes clearly and with rationale
* Keep contributions aligned with the project goals and constraints

More formal contribution guidelines may be added in the future.
